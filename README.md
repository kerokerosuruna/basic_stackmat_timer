# basic_stackmat_timer
A simple stackmat timer

More of a proof of concept thing than anything. It worked by using an rgb led and 2 light sensors to detect your hands being on the timer.

This was made back in 2020, I found it when looking through an old hard drive and figured I would upload it

To use this code, wire up your arduino (uno) board, and connect it to your computer. Through your ide of choice, upload the arduino sketch to your board.
